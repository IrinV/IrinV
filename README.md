# Iryna_Volobuieva
Hi there! I'm Iryna Volobuieva.
And I'm a Junior Software Tester with strong attention to detail. Since I started testing, I learned how important it is to be meticulous and a team player.
 I like new challenges, which made me want to learn more and more about this domain and improve my skills daily. My objective is to excel in 
a challenging and innovative QA work environment and aim to exercise my full potential. Thatâ€™s why I am looking for o company that will give me 
a chance to learn and develop myself as a Software Tester.
